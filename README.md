# Deep-learning-Nanodegree-Program

 This program offers a a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence.It consists of five courses and five projects, which are:
 
 - Neural Networks
 - Convolutional Neural Networks
 - Recurrent Neural Networks
 - Generative Adversarial Networks
 - Deploying a Model
 
 The projects listed are done using Python, NumPy,and PyTorch:
 
 
 - <b>[Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/Monirah-99/Deep-learning-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/Predicting%20Bike%20Sharing%20Patterns)</b>
  
      Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day. This project is done by training a multi-layer neural network, and use it to analyze real data 


 - <b>Project 2: Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media</b>
  
      Build a landmark classifier model to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) .


 - <b>Project 3: Generate TV Scripts</b>
  
      Build Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch. Perform sentiment analysis and generate new text, and use recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts.


 - <b>Project 4: Generate Faces</b>
   
      Implement a Deep Convolutional GAN, its made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.
  
  
 - <b>Project 5: Deploying a model</b>
  
      Train and deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. This model will be trained to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews (positive or negative reviews).A gateway is created for accessing this model from a website.
